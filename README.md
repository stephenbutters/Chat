# Chat

#### Project 1 from UC Berkeley's CS 168 (Introduction to the Internet: Architecture and Protocols)

A simple application that connects users over a network: a chat server. Similar to chat programs like Slack and IRC, the finished chat server will allow users to converse in different channels. Users can create and join channels; once a user is in a particular channel, all messages that she sends will be relayed to all other users in that channel.
